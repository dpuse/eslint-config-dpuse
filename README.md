## About DPUse

[DPUse](https://www.dpuse.app) (Data Positioning & Use) is an in-browser application that positions your data for use through three core activities: sourcing, contextualising, and publishing.

**Sourcing** uses a library of [Connectors](https://www.dpuse.app/connectors) to establish [Connections](https://www.dpuse.app) to applications, databases, file stores, and curated datasets; these connections are subsequently used to configure structured [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) from the underlying sources.

**Contextualising** extracts chronological events from those [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) and maps them into comprehensive [Context Models](https://www.dpuse.app). This gives the DPUse Engine the structural framework needed to generate deterministic transactions, facts, or observations.

**Publishing** uses a library of [Presenters](https://www.dpuse.app) to render standard [Presentations](https://www.dpuse.app) immediately using the contextualised data; additionally, [Cookbooks](https://www.dpuse.app) of [Recipes](https://www.dpuse.app) let you build Data Apps using your preferred tools.

In addition, DPUse provides [Tools](https://www.dpuse.app) used by the application, and you can use them to construct connectors and presenters.

### OpenSSF 🚧

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/dpuse/eslint-config-dpuse/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/dpuse/eslint-config-dpuse)

This project is working towards the [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev) Passing badge, a self-certification covering security policy, vulnerability reporting, build processes, code quality, and more. Currently the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev) provides an independent automated assessment of the project's security practices and is an ongoing area of improvement.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/dpuse/eslint-config-dpuse/security/advisories/new) instead. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the full disclosure policy, contact details, and expected response times.
